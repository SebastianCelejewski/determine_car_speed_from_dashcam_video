2. Convert video into frames (e.g. using Corel Video Studio).
3. Run CSFDV application.
4. Create a new project and point to a directory where your video frames reside.
5. Navigate through the frames and select those for which the lane separation line crosses the frame boundary.
6. Enter video fps.
7. Enter distance between two starting points of lane separation lines (e.g. 12 meters for Polish highways).
8. The application should calculate the speed of the car.

Enjoy.
